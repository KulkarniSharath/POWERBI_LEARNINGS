# Matrix

The matrix automatically aggregates the data and enables you to drill down. You can create matrix visuals in Power BI reports and cross-highlight elements within the matrix with other visuals on that report page. For example, you can select rows, columns, and even individual cells and cross-highlight.

# Dounut

Pie charts consist of a circle divided into segments that represent the component parts of the whole. Donut charts are the same, but with a hole in the center. The axis for a pie or donut chart follows the circumference of the circle.

## What can I use pie and donut charts for?

Pie and donut charts show a percentage breakdown of data, and, as they're visually simple, are well understood by most people. They display the proportions of a dataset (for example, market share) so are effective for highlighting relative sizes.

Use a pie or donut chart to answer:

What is Yâ€™s share of the whole?

What is the ratio of X to Z?

What are the comparative sizes of our business units?

What is the composition of website traffic?

What is the percentage breakdown of X, Y, and Z?

# Gauge 

Gauge charts are used to show progress towards a particular goal. It helps understand to what extent a goal has been completed. Gauge charts are often used to represent key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, manpower productivity, or profits. 

# Map

Build a map card to display geographical data.

This is useful to help your audience visualize differences between markets, and highlight key values in each one.

A map chart provides a visualization of a geographic region, which contains data from the underlying source data. It also provides the ability to highlight subdivisions of that geographic region through conditional formatting. This is particularly useful to highlight differences between your markets or regions, and help devise strategies for them.

# All the visuals and editing in them is covered in this learning part. The data set used is given in the Learnings_Part_1.
