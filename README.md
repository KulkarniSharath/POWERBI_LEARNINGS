# POWERBI_WORK/LEARNINGS
This is a repository for the PowerBI Work/Learnings. Have been trying this out to do it for long time and I think it will be a good one and helpful for all. I will upload all the work done i.e starting from basics like basic visualizations and learn how to use PowerBi to dashboards and projects related to PowerBi in a slow and steady way. 

So please make sure to have a look at this repository and make sure to give the feedback comments so that I can improve the content in it. 

It will include Projects which includes dashboards and reports with the dataset used.
