# Project 2

This Project is based on the Online data survey done by an Analyst, asking many questions about their career.
So Basically the Data Set tells about the survey takers careers, breaking into their Professions, and some basic questions related to their work.
Its a very easy work done here by me so that to build some confidence and get your hands dirty in the start of your BI journey.

I have attached the data set for your reference.

Work done - 

1. Data Loading through CSV file

2. Data Cleaning - this is the most, most important part of this project as most of the columns contained irregularities, unwanted values, extra columns which were not of use. So Data cleaning and removal of columns were a must.

3. Usage of DAX - Used DAX functions to calculate Average Salary of the survey takers by splitting the columns by delimeters

4. Data Visuals and Dashboards and publish in Github
