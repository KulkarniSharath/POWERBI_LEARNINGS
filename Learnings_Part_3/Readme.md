# Learnings Part 3 Includes : 

## 1) Conditional Columns : 

Create new columns using the columns in the table. Steps for it are mentioned in the .pbix file. Follow the steps and create meaningful columns to get meaningful visuals out of it. 

Also Data modeling is also included in it. Connect Unique keys to make models. One of the best ways to take insights from, of what these tables indicate.

## 2) Operations

## 3) Functions

## 4) DAX Functions :

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a library of functions and operators that can be combined to build formulas and expressions in Power Bi.
DAX formulas are used in measures, calculated columns and calculated tables.

### DAX Function

How to do it in Power Bi ???

Follow the steps :

#### Modeling --> New Column
Go to the "Data" section on the left side of the screen and add the new column and make the necessary additions.

You can see that we have added 3 new and diffrent columns using DAX functions. 

First column is the "Sqrt-sales" second is the "Power-sales" and third is the "Round figure value of the Sqrt-sales" column up to 2 digits. you can also check out other ROUND functions in Power Query Editor i.e MROUND, ROUNDDOWN, ROUNDUP etc.

The Power Query editor is smart enough to do all the calculations for you and generate the result for you. You can also see the queries written for each column creation.
